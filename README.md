## Introduction

## About the Project
Car Roulette Game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing users with an entertaining and risk-free gambling experience. There are 8 cars on the betting board, with 4 cars offering a 5x payout and the other 4 cars offering a 20x payout. After the betting time is up, the ring starts moving randomly along the road.

If the ring stops on a car that a player has bet on, they win the corresponding payout, and the winning coins are added to their account. The game is designed to simulate gambling without involving actual money, using coins as a virtual currency.

New users are initially given 251 coins to start the game, and if they run out of coins, they can earn free coins when the ring is running on the road. The game mechanics involve an automated ring movement, random car stops, and different betting options to engage players.

The game has a user-friendly interface, allowing players to place bets with coins of different denominations (10, 50, 100, 500, 10000) from their accounts.

If a player runs out of coins, they have an opportunity to earn free coins while the ring is moving. The right panel displays the history of previous cars in the row, adding a strategic element to the betting process.
